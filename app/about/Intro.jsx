        Fueled by a passion for game development, I embarked on a programming
        journey that began with mastering the intricacies of C++. This low-level
        foundation, demanding both problem-solving skills and a deep
        understanding of core programming concepts, has equipped me to rapidly
        learn and adapt to new languages and technologies. Today, I'm a
        versatile programmer eager to tackle complex challenges and bring
        creative ideas to life through code.
